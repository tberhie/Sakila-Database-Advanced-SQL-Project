# Sakila-Database-Advanced-SQL-Project
This project showcases my ability to write advanced SQL queries and perform data analysis using the Sakila Database, a popular MySQL sample database used for database management, data retrieval, and performance testing.

## Overview
In this project, I worked on a series of advanced SQL queries to manipulate and analyze data from the Sakila database. The queries covered a wide range of SQL topics including:

- Complex joins and subqueries
- Creating views for reusable SQL queries
- Aggregation functions like COUNT(), AVG(), SUM(), etc.
- Data transformation and filtering using WHERE, LIKE, IN, and other clauses
- Performance optimization through indexing and efficient query design
## Key Features:
1. ### Data Retrieval & Aggregation:

- Queries actors who appeared in more than 25 movies
- Retrieves customers who rented specific genres of movies, such as horror films
- Identifies films involving specific keywords in their descriptions (e.g., "Crocodile" and "Shark")

2. ### Subqueries & Views:

- Created a view called actors_portfolio, which combines actor, film, and category data for easy retrieval of actor portfolios.
- Used nested queries to fetch complex results based on multiple criteria.

3. ### Performance Optimization:

- Implemented indexing strategies for efficient data retrieval, especially when working with large datasets.

## Technologies Used:
- SQL (MySQL)
- MySQL Workbench
- Sakila Database
